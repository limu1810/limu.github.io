        <p>Begining in Highschool I worked on many different projects ranging from surgery robot prototypes to mars rovers made from lego technic pieces.</p>
        <P>Many of these projects are lost on a google drive attached to a school account I no longer have accses to.</P> 
        <p>A list of some of my favorite projects from Highschool include:</P>
